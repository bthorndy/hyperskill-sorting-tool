# hyperskill-sorting-tool
A Java project from the Hyperskill learning platform.
This application takes string or integer user inputs and sorts them naturally or by count.

## Project structure
Most of the top level folders contain instruction files for the stages of the project. My own code for the application can be found in [task/src/sorting](task/src/sorting).
